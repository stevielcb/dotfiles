#### CONFIG FILE FORMAT ####
# This script requires a configuration file located at ~/.dotfiles/bin/.jenkins
# The configuration file should contain the following variables:
# BASIC_AUTH_CREDS=username:password
# JENKINS_BASE_URL=http://jenkins:8000

# This script is used to lint Jenkinsfiles using the Jenkins pipeline model converter API.
# Usage: jenkins-linter <path_to_jenkinsfile>
# Example: jenkins-linter my_jenkinsfile

# CONFIG_FILE: Path to the configuration file containing authentication credentials and
#              Jenkins base URL.
# FILE: The Jenkinsfile to be linted, passed as the first argument to the script.

# The script checks for the presence of the configuration file and the httpie command.
# If the configuration file is not found, it exits with an error message.
# If the httpie command is not found, it exits with an error message.

# The script uses the httpie command to send a POST request to the Jenkins pipeline model
# converter API to validate the Jenkinsfile. The response is printed to the console.
